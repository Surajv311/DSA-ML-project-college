# Stock Prediction using ML algorithms<br>
#### My first ML proj to predict stock prices . Data structures & Algo project.<br>
##### The following project uses basic python libraries like <br>
##### numpy,pandas,matplotlib for data analysis.<br>

The various algorithms used are SVM , Linear regression.<br>

The confidence values were also predicted.<br>
